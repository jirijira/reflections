	in git.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	staging area is the area for collecting files to be committed in the same commit.
	it helps group the files that have been changed for the same purpose for the 
	commit.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	add all the files that has been updated for one logical change to staging 
	area before commit. (working directory could have multiple logical change
	at the same time, but adding only the ones related to 1 logical change
	to staging area to commit it into the repository.)

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	affect the production branch. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	it shows the structures of the branches we have. it shows which branches
	contain which commits in the diagram.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	we will have only one branch left which is the branch you checkout when you 
	do the merge. it is represented as joint at one point because it combines
	2 branches together.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
