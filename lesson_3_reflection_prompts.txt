When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i want to share and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because i might be working on something. if it git automatically pulls the 
    changes, it might overwritten the files im working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork - 	exists only on github. copy repository on one git hub account to
    		your own account.
    clone - copy repository from github to local git directory. or
    		copy repository from local git to another local git directory.
    branch - create a new branch in your git structure

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
    on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
