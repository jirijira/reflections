How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    bugs could happen from typos or change made in the newer version. comparing
    the files makes the changes stand out. the changes is usually where the bug
    is located.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can later view the changes made for some purposes. For example, you can
    later refer to the changes you've made to implement feature A when you need
    to implement this same feature in another project.

    You can track what has been done to the project. to identify bugs, for example.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually choosing when to commit is good because each commit represents a logical
    change or a single purpose. you might risk a chance of losing something though if
    you forgot to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git deals a lot with code. in a single project, there are many files inter-
    related. one commit/one change involves a change in many files at once. it's 
    logical to have many files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log or git log --stat shows the history. each history has commit id.
    you can compare between commits using git diff <commit-id-1> <commit-id-2>.
    note that you don't need to put the whole commit-id string. just the first 4-5
    characters is ok. also, to navigate the git log, you can use arrows. to quit
    the log, press q.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because we can checkout the previously commited bug-free version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
